# higher_or_lower


## Implementation of a game where we compaire two users from Instagram and guess whether the second user has a higher or lower follower count. If we are correct, we take the second user and compare it to another user.


#### The users and their relevant information are kept in a dictionary, and available users (ones we haven't played yet) are kept in a set. Once we play the user, it is removed from the set. Users are chosen at random from random.choice(<list>)
